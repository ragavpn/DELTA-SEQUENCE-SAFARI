# DELTA-SEQUENCE-SAFARI
The first task of DELTA

This game consits of 2 modes:
  1. Normal Mode
  2. Hacker Mode

Normal Mode - The snake moves around the board and eats a word in the correct sequence. If it messes up the order, the game ends. After eating one whole word correectly, it's score increases by 1 and it grows in size. The highest score is stored as well and on screen buttons are provided as well. If the Snake eats itself, it dies. There is a timer system, and if the time runs out the game ends. If the snake eats the word correctly, the timer gets incremented by some time.

Hacker Mode - The game further has a lives system: when a snake dies, it loses a life. When all the lives are depleted, the game ends. As the score increases, make the snake move faster. There are power-ups that spawn randomly and gain buffs on eating them, such as shrinking the snake and slowing it down. There is a pause button as well.
